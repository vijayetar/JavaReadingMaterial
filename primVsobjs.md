# Primitives vs Objects  
[Home](./README.md)  
[Reference](https://www.baeldung.com/java-primitives-vs-objects)  

## Types
boolean – 1 bit
byte – 8 bits
short, char – 16 bits
int, float – 32 bits
long, double – 64 bits  

## Memory footprint  
The primitives and objects have different memory occupy arrays of the types under consideration.

We can see either that single-element arrays of primitive types are almost always more expensive (except for long and double) than the corresponding reference type.
