## For Loop
A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.

For a detailed example, have a look at the dedicated post: Java For Loop.

## While Loop
The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.

For a detailed example, have a look at the dedicated post: Java While Loop.

## Do-While Loop
The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.

For a detailed example, have a look at the dedicated post: Java Do-While Loop.
