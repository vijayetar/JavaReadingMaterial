# Objects and Classes  
[Home](./README.md)  
[Reference](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classes.html)  

__Objects__ - have state and behavior  
__Classes__ - provide blue print of the objects, and are needed in java to run methods (it is not a scripting language like JS)  
### Class components:
```
Modifiers such as public, private, and a number of others that you will encounter later.
The class name, with the initial letter capitalized by convention.
The name of the class's parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
The class body, surrounded by braces, {}.
```
### Fields  
They are member variables in a class. 

They need the following for declaration:  
```
Zero or more modifiers, such as public or private.
The field's type.
The field's name.
```
